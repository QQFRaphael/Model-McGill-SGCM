Use the ensemble data (51 years) to get EOFs:

                       Data(51 years)
			    |	
                            |
       	               EOF analyze
		    (get EOFs and PCs)  @1 @2 
                            |   
                            |
	             Plot EOF and PC    @3 @4
			      

******************************************************************************************************************
1 getZ500.f is used to get the ensemble data, file is written in Z500.dat
 
2 getEOFens.f is used to calculate the 51 eigenvectors.(here we only write out the first 10 eigenvectors)
  The data file used is Z500.dat. result is written in Z500EOF. Also the percentages of the eigenvectors 
  have been calculated and written in percEOF_Z500.dat.

3  efficEns.f is used to calculate the 51 PCs of the correspoinding eigenvectors(EOFs). 
   data files needed are Z500.dat and Z500EOF. Result is written in PCsZ500Ens and fort.88.
   fort.88 is used by xmgr to plot the graphics.


4  plotEOFens.f is used to read Z500EOF to and generate files to plot the graphics for EOF
   This work should be done on tropo: /usr/people/jiaxj/ncarplot
