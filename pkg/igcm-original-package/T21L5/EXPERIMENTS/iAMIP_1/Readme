First, for each member, you need to do the monthly average and then extract 
the Z500 field and the SLP field.
1 monthly.exe, monthly.f do monthly average to the results of integrations.
  OUTpred.monthly is generated. Then,you can get rid of the daily data.
  for each exp*, there are totally 51*6 monthly averaged fields.

2a) getZ500.exe extract Z fields from OUTpred.monthly,Z_monthly.dat is generated.
2b) getSLP.exe extract SLP fields from OUTpred.monthly,SLP_monthly.dat is generated.

Second, after you did the first step for all the memberes, you need to do Ensemble
mean to get rid of the internal influence.
3a) getAveZ500.f average Z500 fields for "N" members.Z500.dat is generated.
3b) getAveSLP.f  average SLP fields for "N" members.SLP.dat is generated.

5 use getEnsEOF.f get the EOF of ensemble mean.
